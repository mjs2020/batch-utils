A few batch files that have come in handy.

## collateCsv.bat

Collates all CSV files in its same folder into a single COLLATED.csv file. It also adds the name of the file as the first column of the output.

* Place it into a folder with some csv files
* Run it
* Get a single COLLATED.csv file as output (be careful, header lines will be repeated)

## getDriveListCsv.bat

Asks for the drive for which you want to get a csv file for and then returns the contents of the drive (including subfolders) in a csv file named with the label of the indexed drive.

* Run it
* Select the drive you want to index (currently supports E: F: G: H: J:, you can tweak the code to support other letters or simply change the drive letter of the one you wish to index).
* Get the output csv file
